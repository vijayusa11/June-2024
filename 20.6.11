To call the `ExampleMethod` from your main code, you'll need to integrate it into your workflow. Here's an example structure that demonstrates how to call `ExampleMethod` within the context of your application, alongside other methods such as `CreateExcelForDailyPatientSiteFile` and `SharePointUploader`.

### Step 1: Define Your Methods

Let's assume you have the following methods:

1. `ExampleMethod` (for SharePoint operations, as provided).
2. `CreateExcelForDailyPatientSiteFile` (to create an Excel file).
3. `SharePointUploader` (to upload files to SharePoint).

First, ensure these methods are defined within a class, for instance, `WebScrapping`. Hereâ€™s a simplified example:

```csharp
using System;
using Microsoft.SharePoint.Client;
using System.Security;
using System.IO;

public class WebScrapping
{
    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        string siteUrl = "https://yoursite.sharepoint.com";
        string username = "yourusername";
        string password = "yourpassword";

        SecureString securePassword = new SecureString();
        foreach (char c in password.ToCharArray())
            securePassword.AppendChar(c);

        using (ClientContext context = new ClientContext(siteUrl))
        {
            context.Credentials = new SharePointOnlineCredentials(username, securePassword);

            Web web = context.Web;
            context.Load(web);
            context.ExecuteQuery();

            Console.WriteLine("Web title: " + web.Title);

            FileCreationInformation newFile = new FileCreationInformation
            {
                Content = File.ReadAllBytes("path/to/your/file.txt"),
                Url = "Shared Documents/file.txt",
                Overwrite = true
            };

            List docs = web.Lists.GetByTitle("Documents");
            Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.File uploadFile = docs.RootFolder.Files.Add(newFile);
            context.Load(uploadFile);
            context.ExecuteQuery();
        }
    }

    public void CreateExcelForDailyPatientSiteFile()
    {
        // Implement your logic to create an Excel file
        Console.WriteLine("Excel file created.");
    }

    public void SharePointUploader(string filePath)
    {
        // Implement your logic to upload a file to SharePoint
        Console.WriteLine("File uploaded to SharePoint.");
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Create the Main Program Entry Point

Next, you need to create a main entry point for your application where you can call these methods. Typically, this would be in your `Main` method:

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        WebScrapping webScrapping = new WebScrapping();

        // Call method to create Excel file for daily patient site
        webScrapping.CreateExcelForDailyPatientSiteFile();

        // Path to the file you want to upload
        string filePath = "path/to/your/excel/file.xlsx";

        // Call method to upload the Excel file to SharePoint
        webScrapping.SharePointUploader(filePath);

        // Call ExampleMethod to perform SharePoint operations
        webScrapping.ExampleMethod();

        Console.WriteLine("All operations completed.");
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Ensure All References and Usings are Correct

Make sure your project includes all necessary references and using directives:

```csharp
using System;
using Microsoft.SharePoint.Client;
using System.Security;
using System.IO;
```

### Step 4: Compile and Run

Compile and run your project. The `Main` method will execute the methods in the order specified, creating an Excel file, uploading it to SharePoint, and performing additional SharePoint operations as defined in `ExampleMethod`.
