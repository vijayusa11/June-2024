It looks like you are trying to perform a conditional comparison between `TotalHours` and `NoOfDays` or `TotalHours` depending on certain conditions. There might be issues with the SQL syntax or the logic of the condition.

Let's simplify and correct the condition. Hereâ€™s how you can adjust it:

1. Ensure that the `CASE` statement is properly structured.
2. Make sure the types of `TotalHours` and `NoOfDays` are consistent for comparison.

Here is the revised condition:

```sql
SET @SELECT = @SELECT + ' AND (t1.TotalHours != r.TotalHours OR 
                               (CASE 
                                  WHEN t4.PracticeName = ''CPPE'' AND r.RotaId IS NULL 
                                  THEN t1.TotalHours != t9.NoOfDays 
                                  ELSE t1.TotalHours != r.TotalHours 
                                END) OR 
                               r.TotalHours IS NULL)'
```

This condition checks:
1. If `t1.TotalHours` is not equal to `r.TotalHours`.
2. If the practice name is "CPPE" and `RotaId` is null, then `t1.TotalHours` is not equal to `t9.NoOfDays`.
3. Otherwise, if `t1.TotalHours` is not equal to `r.TotalHours`.
4. Or if `r.TotalHours` is null.

Ensure that `TotalHours` and `NoOfDays` are of comparable types (both numeric or decimal) to avoid type mismatch issues.

Additionally, if `TotalHours` or `NoOfDays` could be null, you might need to handle that in your comparisons as well:

```sql
SET @SELECT = @SELECT + ' AND ((t1.TotalHours IS NOT NULL AND r.TotalHours IS NOT NULL AND t1.TotalHours != r.TotalHours) OR 
                               (t1.TotalHours IS NOT NULL AND 
                                (CASE 
                                   WHEN t4.PracticeName = ''CPPE'' AND r.RotaId IS NULL AND t9.NoOfDays IS NOT NULL 
                                   THEN t1.TotalHours != t9.NoOfDays 
                                   ELSE t1.TotalHours != r.TotalHours 
                                 END)) OR 
                               r.TotalHours IS NULL)'
```

This ensures that you are not comparing null values, which could cause issues in your query.
