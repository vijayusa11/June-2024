To optimize this query for SQL Server, consider the following steps:

1. **Indexing**: Ensure that appropriate indexes are created on columns frequently used in JOINs, WHERE clauses, and ORDER BY clauses. This includes `EmailProcessId`, `ParentEmailProcessId`, `EmailDate`, `DepartmentId`, `CompanyId`, and `FolderId`.

2. **Reducing Subqueries**: Subqueries, especially in SELECT and CASE statements, can be expensive. Replace them with JOINs where possible.

3. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Using CTEs can simplify the query, but they may not always improve performance. Consider temporary tables if the data set is large.

4. **NOLOCK Hint**: Be cautious with `NOLOCK` as it can lead to dirty reads. Ensure this is appropriate for your use case.

5. **Avoid Scalar Functions in SELECT**: Scalar functions like `[dbo].[EmailProcess_GetLatestData]` in the SELECT clause can be performance bottlenecks. Consider inlining these functions or refactoring them.

Here's a revised version of your query with some optimizations:

```sql

**Further Suggestions:**
- Analyze execution plans to identify bottlenecks.
- Ensure statistics are up-to-date using `UPDATE STATISTICS`.
- Consider breaking down complex parts of the query into smaller chunks or temporary tables for intermediate results.
- Limit the number of rows processed initially if possible, and paginate results.
