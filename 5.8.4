Subject: Re: Performance Feedback and 30-Day Observation Plan

Hi Prachi,

Thank you for your feedback and the detailed email outlining the performance challenges and expectations.

I understand the importance of addressing these concerns and appreciate the opportunity to improve. I would like to clarify a few points and provide some context regarding my performance:

1. **Work Pace**: I acknowledge that my pace might seem slow at times, but I have been extending my work hours to ensure that tasks are completed on time. I am committed to improving my efficiency and meeting the set turnaround times (TAT).

2. **Involvement of Others**: While I do seek assistance occasionally, it is to ensure the highest quality of work and to leverage team knowledge for complex tasks. I will strive to take more ownership and rely less on others moving forward.

3. **Body Language and Communication**: I am confident in my communication skills and believe that my body language is professional. I am always open to constructive feedback and would appreciate specific examples or areas where I can improve. Clear guidelines on this will help me align better with the expectations.

I am fully committed to meeting the outlined expectations during the 30-day observation plan from 5th August 2024. I am confident that with focused effort and your support, I can meet and exceed these goals.

Thank you again for the opportunity to improve and for your understanding. Please feel free to reach out if there are any further specifics or additional support you can provide.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
