To upload a file to SharePoint from your `WebScraping` class, you need to use the SharePoint Client Object Model. Here’s how you can modify your existing code to include file upload functionality to SharePoint:

### Step-by-Step Guide to Upload File to SharePoint

1. **Add SharePoint Client Library Reference:**
   Ensure you have the necessary SharePoint Client Object Model library referenced in your project. If not, install it via NuGet Package Manager:
   ```
   Install-Package Microsoft.SharePointOnline.CSOM
   ```

2. **Update Namespaces:**
   Include the necessary namespaces at the top of your `WebScraping` class:
   ```csharp
   using Microsoft.SharePoint.Client;
   using System.Security;
   ```

3. **Modify `ExampleMethod` for SharePoint Upload:**
   Update your `ExampleMethod` (or any other method where you intend to perform SharePoint upload) to include file upload logic. Here’s an updated example based on your previous methods:

   ```csharp
   public void ExampleMethod(string filePath)
   {
       string siteUrl = "https://yoursite.sharepoint.com/sites/yoursite"; // Replace with your SharePoint site URL
       string username = "yourusername@yoursite.onmicrosoft.com"; // Replace with your SharePoint username
       string password = "yourpassword";

       SecureString securePassword = new SecureString();
       foreach (char c in password.ToCharArray())
           securePassword.AppendChar(c);

       using (ClientContext context = new ClientContext(siteUrl))
       {
           context.Credentials = new SharePointOnlineCredentials(username, securePassword);

           Web web = context.Web;
           context.Load(web);
           context.ExecuteQuery();

           Console.WriteLine("Web title: " + web.Title);

           // Provide the relative path within the SharePoint site where you want to upload the file
           string targetFolderUrl = "/sites/yoursite/Shared Documents"; 

           // File details
           string fileName = Path.GetFileName(filePath);
           string targetFileUrl = targetFolderUrl + "/" + fileName;

           // Read file content
           byte[] fileContent = System.IO.File.ReadAllBytes(filePath);

           // Upload file
           FileCreationInformation newFile = new FileCreationInformation
           {
               Content = fileContent,
               Url = targetFileUrl,
               Overwrite = true
           };

           List docs = web.Lists.GetByTitle("Documents");
           Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.File uploadFile = docs.RootFolder.Files.Add(newFile);
           context.Load(uploadFile);
           context.ExecuteQuery();

           Console.WriteLine("File uploaded successfully to SharePoint.");
       }
   }
   ```

### Explanation:

- **ClientContext:** Establishes a connection to the SharePoint site using your credentials (`username` and `securePassword`).
- **FileCreationInformation:** Specifies details of the file to be uploaded, including content, URL (relative to SharePoint site), and overwrite behavior (`Overwrite = true`).
- **Upload Process:** Uses `web.Lists.GetByTitle` to get the document library (`Documents` in this case), then adds the file using `docs.RootFolder.Files.Add(newFile)`.
- **ExecuteQuery:** Commits the file upload operation to SharePoint.

### Usage:

You can call this `ExampleMethod` from your `StartPhoneEntryProcess` method or any other appropriate place in your application where you have the `filePath` of the file you want to upload.

### Notes:

- Make sure to replace `"https://yoursite.sharepoint.com/sites/yoursite"` with your actual SharePoint site URL.
- Replace `"yourusername@yoursite.onmicrosoft.com"` and `"yourpassword"` with your SharePoint credentials.
- Ensure the SharePoint site URL and document library ("Documents") exist and are accessible with the provided credentials.
- Handle exceptions and error scenarios appropriately in your application for robustness.

By following these steps, you should be able to integrate file upload functionality to SharePoint within your `WebScraping` class effectively. Adjust paths, URLs, and error handling as per your specific requirements and SharePoint environment setup.
