To enable multiple selection in a dropdown list using the `@Html.DropDownList` helper in ASP.NET MVC, you need to use the `@Html.ListBox` helper instead. The `DropDownList` helper doesn't support multiple selections, but the `ListBox` helper does.

Here's how you can modify your code to enable multiple selections:

### 1. **Controller: Prepare the Data**

In your controller, you need to prepare the `SelectList` and pass it to the view via `ViewBag` or a model.

```csharp
public ActionResult YourAction()
{
    var empCodeList = new List<SelectListItem>
    {
        new SelectListItem { Value = "1", Text = "EmployeeCode1" },
        new SelectListItem { Value = "2", Text = "EmployeeCode2" },
        new SelectListItem { Value = "3", Text = "EmployeeCode3" },
        new SelectListItem { Value = "4", Text = "EmployeeCode4" },
    };

    ViewBag.EmpCodeList = empCodeList;

    return View();
}
```

### 2. **View: Display the Multi-Select Dropdown**

In your view, use the `@Html.ListBox` helper to enable multiple selections.

```csharp
@Html.ListBox("empCodeId", ViewBag.EmpCodeList as IEnumerable<SelectListItem>, new { @class = "form-control" })
```

### 3. **Handling Multiple Selections in Your Controller**

When you submit the form, the selected values will be sent as an array. Your action method should accept this array to process the selected values.

```csharp
[HttpPost]
public ActionResult YourAction(int[] empCodeId)
{
    if (empCodeId != null)
    {
        // Process the selected empCodeId values
        foreach (var id in empCodeId)
        {
            // Do something with each selected id
        }
    }

    // Return to the view or redirect as needed
    return RedirectToAction("YourAction");
}
```

### 4. **UI Representation**

When rendered, the `ListBox` will allow users to select multiple items by holding the `Ctrl` key (Windows) or `Cmd` key (Mac) while clicking on the items, or by dragging the mouse over multiple items.

### 5. **Styling the ListBox (Optional)**

You can add some CSS to style the `ListBox` control to better fit your UI:

```css
.form-control {
    width: 100%;
    height: 150px; /* Adjust the height as needed */
}
```

### **Summary**
- Use `@Html.ListBox` instead of `@Html.DropDownList` to enable multiple selections.
- Pass the list of items to the view using `ViewBag` or a strongly-typed model.
- Handle the selected values in your controller by accepting an array of integers or strings, depending on your `Value` field.

This will allow users to select multiple employees from the dropdown.
