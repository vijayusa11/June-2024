want to make a condition where if IsStatFlag = 1 and oEnitity.TotalHours is not equal/match to oEnitity.RotaTotalHours 
here oEnitity.RotaTotalHours  sometimes getting null so null is also count as not equal/match
if aboe condition occur then show strreturn otherwise hide
so write a if else condition for below exapmle line
strreturn += "<td>" + oEnitity.EmployeeName + "</td>";
