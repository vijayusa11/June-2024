To prepend `E.` in front of each comma-separated value in `@ColumnNames`, you can split the string, add the `E.` prefix to each value, and then concatenate them back together. Here's how you can do this within your stored procedure:

### Updated Code:

```sql
-- Split @ColumnNames by comma, add 'E.' to each column, and join them back together
DECLARE @PrefixedColumnNames VARCHAR(8000);

-- Replacing comma with comma+space for better readability
SET @PrefixedColumnNames = 'E.' + REPLACE(@ColumnNames, ',', ', E.');

-- Now @PrefixedColumnNames contains the list of columns prefixed with 'E.'

-- Use @PrefixedColumnNames in your dynamic SELECT statement
SET @Select = 'SELECT DISTINCT ' + @PrefixedColumnNames + ' FROM Employees AS E';

-- Add your JOINs, WHERE clauses, etc.
set @Select = @Select + ' LEFT JOIN EmployeeGroups AS EG ON EG.GroupId = E.EmployeeGroupId '
set @Select = @Select + ' LEFT JOIN Employees AS LI ON E.LineManagerId = LI.EmployeeId 
                        LEFT JOIN PDRFilledDetail PFD ON PFD.EmployeeId = E.EmployeeId
                        LEFT JOIN PDRQuestion PQ ON PQ.QuestionId = PFD.QuestionId 
                        LEFT JOIN PDRQuestionOption PQO ON PQO.QuestionId = PQ.QuestionId 	
                        LEFT JOIN #tempEmpTotalPDRScore C ON C.EmployeeId = E.EmployeeId';

-- Add your remaining logic here...

-- Execute the query
exec(@Select);
```

### Explanation:

1. **String Manipulation:**
   - `REPLACE(@ColumnNames, ',', ', E.')` splits the `@ColumnNames` by commas and adds `E.` before each column name.

2. **Building the SELECT Statement:**
   - The dynamically created `@Select` statement now uses `@PrefixedColumnNames`, ensuring that each column name has `E.` prefixed.

3. **Executing the Query:**
   - The final query is executed using `exec(@Select)`.

### Testing Example:

If `@ColumnNames` is `'EmployeeCode,LoginName,DepartmentName'`, the `@PrefixedColumnNames` will become `'E.EmployeeCode, E.LoginName, E.DepartmentName'`, and the final `@Select` will be:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT E.EmployeeCode, E.LoginName, E.DepartmentName FROM Employees AS E
```

This approach ensures that the correct column names are referenced in your SQL query.
